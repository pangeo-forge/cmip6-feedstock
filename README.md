# cmip6-feedstock

**This feedstock will not actually contain recipes anymore, and only be used for all requests to add CMIP data to the cloud that is not currently available in the [Pangeo CMIP6 Cloud holdings](https://pangeo-data.github.io/pangeo-cmip6-cloud/).**

## How to request new datasets
Ideally a request for new datasets includes a list of [instance_ids]() that can be added directly to one of the feedstocks below. [pangeo-forge-esgf](https://github.com/jbusecke/pangeo-forge-esgf) provides a convenient way of getting a list of available datasets directly from ESGF, using a wildcard notation ([example](https://github.com/jbusecke/pangeo-forge-esgf#parsing-a-list-of-instance-ids-using-wildcards)).
